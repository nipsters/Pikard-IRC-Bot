* Description
*****************
Pikard is an IRC bot that can handle temporal bans on IRC and then unban automatically
That's all it does, really. So far, that is.


*****************
* Version History
*****************
-0.2 1/12/2001:
 * Second release!
 * Complete rewrite, now uses the library smartirc4net

-0.1 - 26/11/2011:
 * First release!
 * Capabilities: banning, kicking, unbanning
 * Working as it should. If you exploit it hard it could break


*****************
* Instructions
*****************
I used to launch it with a batch file so I could give start arguments, but I deleted that functionality. Maybe it can be readded in the future.

Just edit Program.cs and modify "Channel" to your likings.

Please note that this bot was heavily tailored to work with FreeNode. So it might not work for every IRC Server.

Attention: If building the project yields a "Missing references" error, delete smartirc4net from the references listing and 
readd it using the smartirc4net dll included here

Commands:
!ban <nickname> <duration> [reason]
!kick <nickname> [reason]
!unban <nickname>
!kickban <nickname>

It also handles private messages:
die
banned
